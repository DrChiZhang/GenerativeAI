# Self-learning code for Generative AI
Follow the lecture of Prof. Wu Yi on [BiliBili清华交叉信息院吴翼主讲-蚂蚁深度学习公开课](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1yFXWY1E7t/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=992a5013db1a9bf76d72a0742386a522), I am leanring foundamentals of Generative AI by coding some important algorithms. 

During the learning, I use ChatGPT or DeepSeek to do the code refactoring. ChatGPT 4.1 is powerfull.
